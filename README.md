# craw

## To get the craw compiler
to get the repository first run 
`git clone "https://github.com/speedskater1610/craw"`.

Next compile the program by running the following
`make all`
this will make a new exacutable for the program 

if for any reason you want to uninstall the craw compiler run
`make clean`, this will remove all of the object files and target exacutable(s)

## To use the craw compiler
at the current time of me writing this (~8am Nov 5), the craw compiler is still in the early stages of development and the lexer is the only part remotly close to being done
