## Progress
- as of right now the lexer is done unless anyother problems arrise or new features get added in the future.
- Same with the assembler, I just need to test it and fix bugs, but it can emit proper ELF binaries as of right now. I will open a pull request for that maybe tonight (Nov 12)
- the next task that we are will be completing is finishing the tag system for compiling craw programs and then starting the preprocessor.
